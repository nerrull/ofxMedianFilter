# ofxMedianFilter
openframeworks implementation of the "median filter" image filter by tsulej : https://github.com/tsulej/GenerateMe

For the moment it only supports the sorting based on pixel hue.

I added some extra controls though

*1 and 2 change the index of sort selector

*wasd shifts the image around

*q and e shift colours read by one byte which gives a nice coloured strobe effect.

Also in this repo is a version of the generateme script with improved performance.
